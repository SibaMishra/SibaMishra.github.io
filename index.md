I am a post doctoral fellow in the **[Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://eecs.iiserb.ac.in/)** at **[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal (IISER Bhopal)](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/)** since May, 2018. My current research spans on the applied inter-disciplinary areas of software engineering, software requirements engineering, natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

More specifically, I am using the constructs of natural language processing and artificial intelligence to improve the quality of software requirements written in natural language semantics. I obtained a PhD at the **[Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitism.ac.in/index.php/Departments/dept_cse)**, **[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/)** in March, 2018.
