More specifically, I am using the constructs of natural language processing and artificial intelligence to improve the quality of software requirements written in natural language semantics. I obtained a PhD at the **[Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitism.ac.in/index.php/Departments/dept_cse)**, **[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/)** in March, 2018.
